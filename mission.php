				<h1><a href="#">The Practice of Change</a></h1>
					<p>OATS harnesses the power of technology to change the way we age. Since 2004, we&#8217;ve innovated one of the nation's most powerful models to shape the future of aging.</p>

			<p>The OATS approach begins with a strong commitment to creative and responsive program design. We know that our most important resource is the energy of older Americans themselves, and we develop programs that engage seniors as change agents—in the classroom, in the community, and at home.</p>
			
			<p>OATS brings deep experience working directly with older adults together with a passion for delivering a world-class experience for seniors. This combination of practical knowledge and mission focus enables us to build programs that bring about meaningful, enduring change. This is what we mean by "the practice of change."</p>
			
			<p>The results? Since 2004 OATS has provided more than 20,000 free technology classes for senior citizens, built more than 30 technology centers for community partners, and provided digital content to over a million people online at SeniorPlanet.org. OATS sponsors the Senior Planet Exploration Center in New York City—the country’s first technology-themed community center for older adults—and works nationally with dozens of nonprofit and corporate partners that help advance our mission.</p>
